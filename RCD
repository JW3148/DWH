Rapid Changing Dimension
dimension attribute that changes very frequently,
for example, a custom status may change pretty frequently because of his buying bahaviour
for example, stock portifolio risk indicatior change day by day

Issue: This gonna be a problem when you want to implement this column as Type 2 SCD, i.e you want to keep historical info.
as a type 2 SCD, each time a change happens, you need to add a records. 

Gonna be too many records!!!

Solution: Junk Dimension with Conjunctioned table

Put the rapid changing attribute in to a Junk Dimension
  one time load, with all combinatinations.

Create a conjunction table
  many to many relation ship: 
  one record in the parent dimention can be associate multiple records in just dimenesion
  (i.e. current and historical); one record in the junk corresbonding to multple record in the parent demension
  
Maintain:
  a change in RCD attribute --> add new reocord in con table, mark as active
  a change in type 2 SCD in parent dimension.this will cause new key added the parental dimension
  --> therefore new key need to be added to the conjuncated table, point to the same junk key, both active
  a change happens same time --> SCD THEN RCD
  
  
IMPLEMENTATION
  NEW DIM
  SCD1
  SCD2
  SCD2 RCD
